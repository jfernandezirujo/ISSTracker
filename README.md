# ISSTracker

ISSTracker app is built with SwiftUI, following the MVVM pattern and incorporating Dependency Injection, Combine, and Clean Code principles for a modular and maintainable codebase.

The app provides real-time tracking of the International Space Station (ISS), displaying its current location and movement across the globe. Users can access the last known position offline, thanks to Core Data for local storage. The architecture is designed with scalability in mind, following SOLID principles for clean and efficient code.

Key technologies include SwiftUI for the user interface, Combine for reactive programming, Core Data for local storage, and a RESTful API for real-time ISS data. Dependency Injection enhances modularity and testability.
